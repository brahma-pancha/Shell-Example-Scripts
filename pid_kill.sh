#Here's a basic shell script to check the status of a process and kill it if it is running

#!/bin/bash

# Define the process name
process_name="process_to_check"

# Check if the process is running
if pgrep -x "$process_name" > /dev/null; then
  echo "$process_name is running, killing it now..."
  # Kill the process
  kill $(pgrep -x "$process_name")
else
  echo "$process_name is not running."
fi

#In this script, the process_name variable holds the name of the process you want to check. The script uses the pgrep command to search for the process and the kill command to terminate it if it is found to be running. The -x option to pgrep matches exact process names, which ensures that only processes with the exact name specified in the process_name variable will be affected. The output of the script will indicate whether the process was running and was killed, or if it was not running
