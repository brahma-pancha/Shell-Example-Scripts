#Here's an example of a shell script that creates multiple users at once and resets their password in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or similar systems

#!/bin/bash

# Define an array of users to be created
users=("user1" "user2" "user3")
password="password123"

# Loop through the array and create users
for user in "${users[@]}"; do
  # Check if user exists, if not create it
  if ! id "$user" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    useradd "$user"
    echo "User $user created"
  else
    echo "User $user already exists"
  fi

  # Reset user password
  echo "$user:$password" | chpasswd
  echo "Password for $user reset"
done

#In this script, the users array contains a list of users to be created. The for loop iterates over the array and checks if each user already exists. If the user does not exist, it is created using the useradd command. Regardless of whether the user exists or not, their password is reset using the chpasswd command. The script outputs the results of each step to the console.
