#Here is a simple shell script that uses the cp command to copy files and folders to a different location

#!/bin/bash

src_dir="/path/to/source"
dst_dir="/path/to/destination"

cp -r $src_dir $dst_dir


#The -r option is used to copy directories recursively. The src_dir and dst_dir variables hold the path to the source and destination directories, respectively.

#This script assumes that the source and destination directories exist and that the user running the script has the necessary permissions to read from the source directory and write to the destination directory.
