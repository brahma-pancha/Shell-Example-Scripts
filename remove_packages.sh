#Here is a simple shell script that demonstrates how to remove packages from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system when they are no longer needed


#!/bin/bash

# Remove a specific package
yum remove <package-name>

# Remove multiple packages
yum remove <package-name-1> <package-name-2> <package-name-3>

# Remove a package and its dependencies
yum autoremove <package-name>

#The yum command is used to manage packages on a RHEL system. The remove option is used to remove one or more packages from the system. You can specify the name of the package you want to remove after the remove option. You can also specify multiple package names separated by a space.

#If you want to remove a package and its dependencies, you can use the autoremove option followed by the name of the package. This option will remove the package and any packages that depend on it, but leave packages that depend on the removed package intact.
