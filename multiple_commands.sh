#Here's an example of a shell script that combines multiple commands and executes the output

#!/bin/bash

# Define variables for command outputs
disk_space=$(df -h)
memory_usage=$(free -m)
current_users=$(who)

# Combine the outputs into a single string
output="DISK SPACE\n$disk_space\n\nMEMORY USAGE\n$memory_usage\n\nCURRENT USERS\n$current_users"

# Execute the combined output
echo -e "$output"

#In this script, the df command is used to display the disk space usage in human-readable format. The free command is used to display the memory usage in megabytes. The who command is used to display the currently logged in users. These outputs are stored in separate variables: disk_space, memory_usage, and current_users. The outputs are then combined into a single string, output, and executed using echo -e "$output". The -e option is used to enable the interpretation of backslash escapes, allowing the line breaks and newlines in the output to be displayed correctly
