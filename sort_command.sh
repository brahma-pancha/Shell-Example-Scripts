#Here is a simple shell script that uses the sort command to sort text and numerical data, reverse the output, and remove duplicate results


#!/bin/bash

input_file="/path/to/input_file"

# Sort the contents of a file in ascending order (default)
sort $input_file

# Sort the contents of a file in descending order
sort -r $input_file

# Sort the contents of a file numerically in ascending order
sort -n $input_file

# Sort the contents of a file numerically in descending order
sort -nr $input_file

# Remove duplicates from a sorted file
sort $input_file | uniq

#The input_file variable holds the path to the file you want to sort. The sort command is used to sort the contents of a file. The -r option is used to sort the contents in reverse order. The -n option is used to sort the contents numerically, rather than as text. The uniq command is used to remove duplicates from a sorted file.

#This script will sort the contents of a file in ascending order (the default), descending order, numerically in ascending order, numerically in descending order, and remove duplicates from a sorted file. The sorted and filtered data will be output to the console.
