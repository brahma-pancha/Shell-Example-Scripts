#A script to combine multiple files into a single file

#!/bin/bash

# Define the input files and the output file
input_files=(/path/to/file1.txt /path/to/file2.txt /path/to/file3.txt)
output_file="/path/to/combined_file.txt"

# Combine the input files into a single output file
cat "${input_files[@]}" > "$output_file"

#In this script, the input_files array holds the paths to the input files, and the output_file variable holds the path to the output file. The script uses the cat command to combine the contents of the input files and redirect the output to the output file using the > operator. The "${input_files[@]}" syntax is used to pass each element of the input_files array as a separate argument to the cat command





#A script to split a large file into smaller files

#!/bin/bash

# Define the input file and the size of each output file
input_file="/path/to/input_file.txt"
output_size=1024

# Split the input file into smaller output files
split -b "$output_size"K "$input_file" "${input_file%.txt}_part_"

#In this script, the input_file variable holds the path to the input file, and the output_size variable holds the size of each output file in kilobytes. The script uses the split command to split the input file into smaller output files. The -b option is used to specify the size of each output file, and the K suffix is used to indicate kilobytes. The output files are named using the "${input_file%.txt}_part_" syntax, which removes the .txt extension from the input file name and appends _part_ to the output file names
