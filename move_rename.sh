#Here is a simple shell script that uses the mv command to move and rename files in a directory


#!/bin/bash

src_file="/path/to/source_file.txt"
dst_file="/path/to/destination_file.txt"

mv $src_file $dst_file


#The src_file and dst_file variables hold the path to the source file and the destination file, respectively. The mv command moves the file from the source location to the destination location, and if the destination file already exists, the file is renamed.

#This script assumes that the source file exists and that the user running the script has the necessary permissions to read the source file and write to the destination file
