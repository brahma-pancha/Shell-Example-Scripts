#Here is a simple shell script that demonstrates how to use the yum software repositories to install new packages on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system


#!/bin/bash

# Install a specific package
yum install <package-name>

# Install multiple packages
yum install <package-name-1> <package-name-2> <package-name-3>

# Install all packages from a specific repository
yum --enablerepo=<repo-name> install <package-name>

#The yum command is used to manage packages on a RHEL system. The install option is used to install one or more packages. You can specify the name of the package you want to install after the install option. You can also specify multiple package names separated by a space.

#If you want to install a package from a specific repository, you can use the --enablerepo option followed by the name of the repository.
