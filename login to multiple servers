Here's an example shell script that logs in to multiple servers and adds a file to each of them:

#!/bin/bash

# Define the servers and credentials
SERVERS=("server1.example.com" "server2.example.com" "server3.example.com")
USERNAME="your_username"
PASSWORD="your_password"
FILE_CONTENT="This is an example file."

# Loop through the servers and add the file to each one
for SERVER in "${SERVERS[@]}"
do
  echo "Connecting to $SERVER..."
  sshpass -p "$PASSWORD" ssh "$USERNAME"@"$SERVER" "echo '$FILE_CONTENT' > example_file.txt"
done

#This script defines an array of server names and a username and password for authentication. It also defines the contents of the file that will be added to each server.
#The script then uses a for loop to iterate over each server in the array. For each server, it prints a message indicating which server it is connecting to, and then uses the sshpass and ssh commands to log in to the server and add the file with the specified contents.
#Note that, as in the previous examples, this script uses a password-based authentication method, which is not considered secure. You should consider using other authentication methods like SSH keys. Additionally, this script assumes that the user has permission to create files in the desired location on each server. If the user does not have permission, the file creation will fai
