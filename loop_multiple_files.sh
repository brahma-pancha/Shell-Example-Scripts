#Here is an example shell script that demonstrates how to use the for loop to perform actions on multiple files in a file system

#!/bin/bash

# Set the directory to search for files
search_dir="~/Documents"

# Set the pattern for the files to search for
pattern="*.txt"

# Use the find command to search for files matching the pattern
files=$(find $search_dir -name $pattern)

# Loop through the list of files
for file in $files; do
  # Display the name of the file
  echo "Processing file: $file"
  # Perform some action on the file, such as copying it to a different location
  cp $file ~/Documents/backup
done

#In this script, the search_dir variable is set to the directory to search for files, and the pattern variable is set to the pattern for the files to search for. The find command is used to search for files matching the pattern, and the output of the find command is stored in the files variable. The for loop is used to loop through the list of files, and perform some action on each file. In this case, the action is to display the name of the file and copy it to a different location.
