#Here's an example of a shell script that sends an email using the mail command:

#!/bin/bash

# Define email parameters
to="recipient@example.com"
subject="Test Email"
message="This is a test email sent from a shell script."

# Send email using mail command
echo "$message" | mail -s "$subject" "$to"

#In this example, the script defines the recipient email address, subject, and message body in the variables to, subject, and message, respectively. The message is then sent using the mail command, with the -s flag specifying the subject and the recipient email address as an argument.

#Note: To use this script, you will need to have a mail server set up and configured on the system where the script is being run. If you do not have a mail server, you can use a third-party email service like Gmail to send emails from a shell script.
